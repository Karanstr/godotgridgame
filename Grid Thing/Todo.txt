Todo
	- Clean up/optimise collision meshing 
	- - Mesh Culling to minimize collision objects in scene at once
	
	- Implement Center of Mass
	- - Allow render and collision shapes to move based on center of mass
	- - Allow automatic recalculation of center of mass
	
	- Implement multi chunk(64x64 blocks) objects
	- -/ Add infrastructure for instancing chunks
	- - Add ability to offset chunks from eachother (and recenter chunks when adding/removing them?)
	
	Todo I Don't Wanna Do
	- Add saving and loadng of grid
	- Figure out sleeping issue when updating collision boxes


Done
	-/ Create bitField Class
	-/ Implement bitField for block tracking in global/grid.gd
	-/ Implement area reading of a bitField
	-/ Implement binary greedymeshing
	-/ Create collision boxes based on meshes
	-/ Make _rowToBits() only use a single box
