Todo
	- Grid QOL
	- - Raystepping between mouse prior and current positions to prevent skipping while dragging? 
	
	- Implement Center of Mass
	- - Allow render and collision shapes to move based on center of mass
	- - Allow automatic recalculation of center of mass
	
	- Implement multi chunk(64x64 blocks) objects
	- -/ Add infrastructure for instancing chunks
	- - Add ability to offset chunks from eachother (and recenter chunks when adding/removing them?)
	
	- Stuff I don't want to do
	- - Add saving and loading of grid
	- - Figure out sleeping issue when updating collision boxes
	
	- Clean up/optimise collision meshing 
	- - Mesh culling to minimize collision objects in scene at once

Done
	-/ Create bitField Class
	-/ Implement bitField for block tracking in global/grid.gd
	-/ Implement area reading of a bitField
	-/ Implement binary greedymeshing
	-/ Create collision boxes based on meshes
	-/ Make _rowToBits() only use a single box
	-/ Add class for storing extensive block data
	-/ Allow drag editing of a chunk
	-/ Allow chunks to toggle edit-ability
