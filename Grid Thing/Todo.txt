Todo
	- Implement multi chunk(64x64 blocks) objects
	- Figure out sleeping issue when updating collision boxes
	- Add saving and loadng of grid
	- Clean up/optimise collision meshing 

Done
	-/ Create bitField Class
	-/ Implement bitField for block tracking in global/grid.gd
	-/ Implement area reading of a bitField
	-/ Implement binary greedymeshing
	-/ Create collision boxes based on meshes

When (if) the engine fails us
	- Performant raystepping
	- - Implement binary corner detection
	- - - Figure out how to handle transition between multiple bitBoxes
