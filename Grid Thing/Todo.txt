Todo
- Manage collision areas based on mesh
- - Construct new collision rects when old mesh is updated
- - Destroy old collision rects when mesh is updated
- - Preserve collision rects unnafected by mesh updates(?)
- Allow greedymesher to handle row lengths of more than a bitBox (64 bits)
- Figure out sleeping issue when updating collision boxes
- Add saving and loadng of grid



Done
-/ Create bitField Class
-/ Implement bitField for block tracking in global/grid.gd
-/ Implement area reading of a bitField
-/ Implement binary greedymeshing



When (if) the engine fails us
- Performant raystepping
- - Implement binary corner detection
- - - Figure out how to handle transition between multiple bitBoxes
