Todo
	- Technical Things
	- - Object detection
	- - -/ Detect distinct (non touching) objects on adjacent faces
	- - - Split objects when they are distinct
	- - - -/ Refactor entire grid system to simplify loading/saving process
	- - - - Actually load/save data now that it's easy
	- - Add (two?) bits of info for everything to specify if it has special data
	- -  - One bit for special data, one bit for whether that special data affects it visually
	- - - Don't greedy mesh objects with visually distinct special data
	- - - Way to store/recall special data
	- - Implement mass-updating of the grid (without just calling modify a bunch?)
	- - Allow for different collision shapes/meshes
	
	- Implement multi chunk(64x64 blocks) objects
	- - Add ability to offset chunks from eachother (and recenter chunks when adding/removing them?)
	- - Allow center of mass to be influenced by all chunks properly
	- - Broadcast old and new mass of a chunk to chunkmanager for more efficient mass updates
	
	- Clean up/optimise collision meshing 
	- - Mesh culling to minimize collision objects in scene at once (2d Occlusion cullingish)
	
	- Grid
	- - Raystepping between mouse prior and current positions to prevent skipping while dragging? 
	
	- Other Collision Stuff
	- - Figure out sleeping issue when updating collision boxes

Done
	-/ Create bitField Class
	-/ Implement bitField for block tracking in global/grid.gd
	-/ Implement area reading of a bitField
	-/ Implement binary greedymeshing
	-/ Create collision boxes based on meshes
	-/ Make _rowToBits() only use a single box
	-/ Add class for storing extensive block data
	-/ Allow drag editing of a chunk
	-/ Allow chunks to toggle edit-ability
	-/ Modify mesh rendering to support textures (sprites)
	-/ Add infrastructure for instancing chunks
	-/ Read cached point masses for blockTypes which weren't updated
	-/ Allow automatic recalculation of center of mass
	-/ Implement Center of Mass
