I've ditched this one too to move to rust. Godot's node system wants you to put everything in a box in their tree, but I don't like their boxes or their tree. Stuff like drawing to the screen was so much work, and I only moved to Godot from Javascript bc Godot has a physics engine. I don't actually care anymore bc how hard can it be to make a physics engine, so we're gaming
